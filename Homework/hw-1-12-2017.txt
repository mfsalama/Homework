Hw-1-12-2017 : Week 1

a)Absolute vs Relative Paths:

1. No: . stands for the current directory.
2.No: / stands for the root directory.
3. No: Amanda’s home directory is /Users/amanda.
4. No: this goes up two levels, i.e. ends in /Users.
5. Yes: ~ stands for the user’s home directory, in this case /Users/amanda.
6. No: this would navigate into a directory home in the current directory if it exists.
7. Yes: unnecessarily complicated, but correct.
8. Yes: shortcut to go back to the user’s home directory.
9.  Yes: goes up one level

b)Relative Path Resolution:
1. No: there is a directory backup in /Users.
2. No: this is the content of Users/thing/backup, but with .. we asked for one level further up.
3. No: see previous explanation. Also, we did not specify -F to display / at the end of the directory names.
4. Yes: ../backup refers to /Users/backup.

c)Ls Reading Comprehension:

1. ls pwd
2. ls -r -F
3. ls -r -F /Users/backup
4. Either #2 or #3 above, but not #1.

d)Exploring more ls Arguments: 

The -l arguments makes ls use a long listing format, showing not only the file/directory names but also additional 
information such as the file size and the time of its last modification. The -h argument makes the file size “human readable”, 
i.e. display something like 5.3K instead of 5369.
